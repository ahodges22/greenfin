# Greenfin
This is a customized version of `bluefin-dx:stable-daily` built for Framework laptops. The main changes are:

* An enabled modification to disable the fingerprint reader if the laptop's lid is closed. So no more fingerprint prompts when docked with a closed lid.
* 1Password installed with Firefox for seamless integration between the two, with support for 1Password using system authentication (and fingerprint) for unlocking.
* My favorite terminal emulator Tilix that is not available as a Flatpak.
* The GitHub Desktop app that I like to use, but the Flatpak version is a bit buggy.
* The framework_tool binary set up, which can be used to do things like set the battery charging threshold from the OS.
